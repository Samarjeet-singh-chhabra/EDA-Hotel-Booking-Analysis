# **EDA-Hotel-Booking-Analysis**
Exploring and analyzing the dataset of hotel_booking to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

## Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

## Data provided
We were provided with a dataset of hotel booking data from 2015 to 2017 with 119390 Rows and 32 Columns. All personal details have been removed. click to open
